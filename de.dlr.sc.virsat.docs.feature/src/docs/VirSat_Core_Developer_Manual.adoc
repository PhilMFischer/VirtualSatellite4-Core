== Getting Started

Learn about basic requirements of Virtual Satellite Developers IDE, how it is installed and begin your first development.

=== System Requirements 

Virtual Satellite Developer IDE is based on the Eclipse for Plugin Developer.
It has been extended by some additional tools that we require for our development, e.g. checkstyle or overtarget.
Additionally, the IDE contains the Concept Language, the implementation of the Generic Systems Engineering Language (GSEL).
This language is based on xtext and it is the simple entry point to start enhancing the Conceptual Data Model of Virtual Satellite for your individual needs. 

The Developers IDE currently supports the following operating system configurations:

. Windows 7 64bit with Java 8 runtime environment
. Linux 64 bit with Java 8 runtime environment

[WARNING]
.Use 64 bit Java JRE
====
Virtual Satellite does not execute on a Java 32 bit runtime environment.
====

NOTE: The Developers IDE supports newer Java versions same as eclipse. Nevertheless, Virtual Satellite still requires Java version 8. 

=== Different Ways to Develop Virtual Satellite

Virtual Satellite offers three different ways to be a developer. 
All of them require different sets of skills and offer different ways of contributing.

The first set is called *Virtual Satellite App Developer*.
Developing an App is described in the User Manual.
Apps are usually programmed directly within a project and contain project specific processing of the modeled data.
Apps can be developed directly from within Virtual Satellite and do not require special setup.

The second way is called the *Virtual Satellite Concept Developer*. 
A Concept is an extension to the Virtual Satellite Conceptual Data Model (CDM).
A Concept offers new ways of modeling to the user. 
These new ways are usually process specific, meaning depending on your understanding of modeling a spacecraft.
Once a Concept is developed it can be deployed and installed into any Virtual Satellite instance.
Thus a Concept can be easily shared and reused across projects.
Developing a concept requires some programming skills and requires to install the Virtual Satellite Developer IDE.
A Concept is developed based on the Concept Language which is an xtext implementation of our Generic Systems Engineering Language (GSEL).
This xtext language is an easy to use entry point to create new modeling items.
Code generators create all neccessary code to get started.
More advanced developers can override this generated code for further detailed modifications.

The third way is called *Virtual Satellite Infrastructure Developers*.
infrastructure Developers work on the core and basis of Virtual Satellite.
This requires a high knowledge of Virtual Satellite, Eclipse and Java.
It also requires to install the Virtual Satellite Developer IDE.

=== The Modular Conceptual Data Model

=== Virtual Satellite / Eclipse IDE Installation

Installing Virtual Satellite Developers IDE is as easy as possible.
Provided that a Java Runtime Environment is installed to your system.
Follow the steps below to install Virtual Satellite Developers IDE on a windows system: 

NOTE: Installation steps on linux are very similar.

Special topics are discussed in this chapter.
Developers should read this part to get a better understanding for certain decisions in Virtual Satellite.

=== Third party libraries

The simplest way to load a third party JAR library is to pack it into an OSGI/Equinox plugin.
This plugin can then be used as a dependency wherever it is needed.
The following example shows how a library such as `json-simple` is integrated. The Figure "<<ExternalLibraryJson-Simple-Bundled>>" shows the file structure of the plugin.

.The external third party library json-simple bundled into a plugin.

Third party libraries get placed into the `externalLib` folder.
The sources are usually placed here as well for legal reasons.
The individual licenses are stored here as well as in the `about_files` folder.
Now, to make these libraries accessible from other plugins three things need to be done.

First, these libraries have to be added to the runtime classpath of the plugin as shown in Figure "<<ExternalLibraryClassPathAndPackages>>".
This can be done from the _Manifest Editor_.
The classpath gets extended by adding the new library on the _Runtime_ tab.
Then the packages of the imported library can be exported.

Second the external library has to be bundled into the plugin.
This way the jar which extends the runtime classpath is present and can actually be loaded.
In the _Build_ tab of the _Manifest Editor_, the `externalLib` folder and all of its sub-folders and files should be marked for the _binary build_ as shown in Figure "<<ExternalLibraryBinaryBuild>>".

Third and finally, the library has to be registered for correct compilation in eclipse.
Therefore it has to be added to the build class path of the plugin.
The _Build Path Editor_  in Figure "ExternalLibraryBuildPath" can be accessed by the context menu menu:Context[Build Path > Configure Build Path...].
The libraries of the `externalLib` folder have to be listed here.
Additionally they can be linked with their source or javadoc libraries as well.
