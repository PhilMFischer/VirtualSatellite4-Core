It has been a long way to get here and it will be an even harder way to go on. Thanks to everyone who contributed so far.

== Getting Started

=== System Requirements 

Virtual Satellite is based on Java and Eclipse Technology. It currently supports the following operating system configurations

. Windows 7 64bit with Java 8 runtime environment
. Linux 64 bit with Java 8 runtime environment

[WARNING] 
.Linux compilation issues
==== 
Some dependencies to C and C++ libraries are build on a Suse Linux Enterprise Distribution (SLED). A recompilation when using other distributions is probably needed. This concerns e.g. the visualization functionality absed on the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).
====

=== Installation

Installing Virtual Satellite is as easy as possible. Provided that a Java Runtime environment is installed to your system. Follow the steps below to install Virtual Satellite on a windows system: 

NOTE: Installation steps on linux are very similar.
