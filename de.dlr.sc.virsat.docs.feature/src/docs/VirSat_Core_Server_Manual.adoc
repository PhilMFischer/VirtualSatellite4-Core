== Introduction

Virtual Satellite can be run headless as a server that provides a REST API. 
The REST API can be used to access and manipulate the Virtual Satellite model without the user interface.
It also functions as an interface to connect Virtual Satellite to your own application.
The API supports the standard HTTP commands GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.

== Overview
#TODO: xcheck and update#

The Figure "<<RestServerOverview>>" gives an overview of the Server and its environment.

A Server instance can maintain multiple Server Repositories, with each repository connected to a git or SVN server.
REST Clients can access the server using the HTTP commands GET, PUT, DELETE and POST. 
So a client can read or write into the Virtual Satellite model. 
The server has to provide functionality for administrators, that can manipulate the server configuration, and users.
For that purpose it needs authentication and authorization.
For authentication purposes an LDAP server can be connected to the REST server.
The connection can be secured via HTTPS.
Because every user can only access certain provided Server Repositories, there has to be a second authorization layer.

The connected SVN/git repositories can also be directly changed from Clients using Virtual Satellite UI.
So the server needs to resolve these conflicts and also handle simultaneous changes from multiple REST clients.
The SVN/git repository is supposed to be the single source of truth in those cases.

== Components

Figure "<<RestServerComponents>>" gives a more detailed view on the REST Server components.

The server is divided into three main layers: the REST API (View), Controllers and Persistence (Model).
Between the API and the controller also is an access check layer.

A REST Client can send a request to the provided REST API that is partitioned into multiple Resources:
An Admin Resource, in which an administrator can manipulate the server configuration, e.g. if the server should use HTTP or HTTPS.
Each Server Repository provided has its own Resource.

In the access check layer the credentials are obtained from the HTTP Header and it is checked if the requested Resources can be accessed.
The credentials are handed over to be used for user role handling in the Virtual Satellite model.

Each Resource has an Controller.
The main controller is the Server Controller handling the Admin Resource.
In it's Server Configuration the server settings are stored.
The Repository Controllers access the data model of the corresponding server repositories.

The persistence level is composed of Server Repositories, each with a Repository Configuration and a data model. 
The data model is connected to a SVN or GIT backend.

== The REST API

The REST API can be accessed via the 
[subs=+quotes]
....
{*server adress*}:8000/rest
....
and currently supports multiple APIs for different purposes.
Each API can be accessed via it's *name* and *version number*:
[subs=+quotes]
....
{*server adress*}:8000/rest/{*name*}/{*version number*}
....

Currently the following APIs are provided:

* The Model API to access Virtual Satellite Models ({*name*} = *model*)
* The Management API for administrative tasks ({*name*} = *management*)

The following documentation of the REST endpoints is automatically generated using Swagger.
For each API the swagger documentation also is provided via the REST API at:
[subs=+quotes]
....
{*server adress*}:8000/rest/{*name*}/{*version number*}/swagger.json or /swagger.yaml
....

It can help you, if you wan't to connect Virtual Satellite to your own application.
E.g. it can be used to automatically generate your client, using Swaggers Codegen capabilities.

=== How to run your own Headless Virtual Satellite Server

:step: 0
#TODO: Format and more images#
[%header,cols=">8,62a,40a"] 
|===

|Step
|Task
|Image

|{counter:step}.
|Download the Virtual Satellite Server zip-file from the GitHub releases section.
|image:chapterInstallation/DownloadGitHubRelease.png[Download]

|{counter:step}.
|Create a configuration file that contains all required configuration (see <<The Configuration File>>).
|

|{counter:step}.
|Start the Server executable with *"-configFile {path}"* (defaults to "resources/server.properties")
|

|===

The Server will start and try to load the repositories.
Instead of using the REST API you can also add repositories manually 
(see <<How to add a Repository manually instead of using the REST API>>).


[WARNING]
.Connection is UNSECURED by default
====
By default the REST server communicates over HTTP, so your credentials (username and password) are transmitted unencrypted.
====

TIP: Configure the server to use the secure HTTPS connection.

==== The Configuration File

By convention this file is named "server.properties".

.server.properties
[[server-properties]]
[subs=+quotes]
....
# Default properties for Virtual Satellite Server configuration
*repository.configurations.dir* = ...
 
# Directory into which all projects will be checked out from their repositories. NOT the workspace
*project.repositories.dir* = ...
 
# Class of the login service
*login.service.class* = *org.eclipse.jetty.security.HashLoginService*
 
# Location of the .properties file for authentication (*WARNING*: will only be used if the HashLoginService is used)
*auth.propierties.file* = ...
....

==== How to add a Repository manually instead of using the REST API

Create a {*repository*}.properties file located in *repository.configurations.dir* (see <<server-properties>>):

.{*repository*}.properties
[subs=+quotes]
....
# The name used in the REST API
*project.name* = ...
*repository.backend* = {*GIT* or *SVN*}
*repository.remoteURI* = {*uri*}
*repository.localPath* = {*localPath*}
*repository.credentials.username* = ...
*repository.credentials.password* = ...
....

This will checkout the repository at {*uri*} into *project.repositories.dir*/repo_{localPath} at the next Server start.
